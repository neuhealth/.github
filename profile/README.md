<h1>Better neurology care is here. Just ask the data.</h1>

Backed by over a decade of Oxford research, Kneu turns smartphones into clinical-grade monitors for Parkinson’s and dementia—helping patients feel more confident, easing clinician workload, and lifting pressure from healthcare systems.

### Parkinson’s disease & dementia are on the rise

More people are living longer with complex conditions, but the support available is falling short of what’s needed.

### No two patient journeys are the same

Parkinson’s and dementia care is complex. Yet patients often have to rely on brief check-ins, managing complexity without real-time insight.

### The system is paying the price

When conditions are underdiagnosed and undertreated, patients end up in crisis and health systems struggle to bear the load.

### Kneu is the neurology platform built for complexity, pressure, and change.

* **Earlier, smarter detection** - Kneu’s MHRA-registered technology uses smartphones to capture continuous data, enabling earlier diagnosis, and proactive care in a field where late detection is the norm.
* **Care that changes lives** - Kneu turns everyday data into better treatment. 53% of patients have medication changes based on the platform’s insights, leading to improvements in quality of life.
* **Less burden on clinicians** - With clear visibility between visits, Kneu reduces guesswork and admin load. Case studies show 80% fewer patient calls and 20% shorter clinic visits, freeing time for more complex care.
* **Stronger health systems** - EHR-integrated, Kneu supports systemwide adoption. NHS pilots saved 1,000 bed days per hospital per year with a 1% drop in Parkinson’s admissions (vs. a 3.2% rise nationally).
